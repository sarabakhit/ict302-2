Campus population at the University of Kentucky continues to rise, with nearly 39,000 students and faculty contributing to a more crowded environment. This increase reflects national patterns, as U.S. undergraduate enrollment grew by 3.2% in 2023 (T2 Systems, 2023). With larger classes come more cars—brought by both in-state and out-of-state students as well as commuting staff.

This growth places heavy strain on parking infrastructure. What was once a small inconvenience has become a daily frustration. Surrounding Lexington neighborhoods are also affected by reduced parking availability. UK is far from alone—universities nationwide are struggling to balance campus expansion with accessibility, sustainability, and limited physical space.
