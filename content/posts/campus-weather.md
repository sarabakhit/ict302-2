## Why you should be weary of the Weather

Weather directly changes how campus parking behaves:

- Rainy days mean Increased traffic, slower walking times, more full garages
    
- Snow or ice mean Delayed arrivals, limited lot access, higher citation risk
  
- Hot and Sunny means More driving, fewer walkers  

If weather is poor, expect:
- Faster lot fill times  
- More congestion near garages  
- Increased stress during peak class arrival windows
