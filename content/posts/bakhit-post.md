## UKY Parking Assistance Qualification Program

Parking at the University of Kentucky currently costs over $500 per year for many students and staff. For individuals who must drive daily due to work schedules, disabilities, family obligations, or long commuting distances, this creates a serious financial burden.

This page provides a needs-based parking assistance program designed to identify and prioritize individuals who rely on their vehicles the most.

This program is part of a UKY Parking ICT Project and is currently in pre-alpha. 

*note that this program is still in development and might be axed by the University of Kentucky's budget office in the future If you are seeing this page then we haven't been taken down.*

## Purpose of This Program

This qualification form is designed to:

Identify students and staff who require daily parking
assist those who are burdened by the financial strain caused by parking costs
  
  We want to Prioritize and help individuals who:
  - Commute daily
  - Live on campus but must park
  - Have medical or accessibility needs
  - Support future parking assistance funding proposals

Students and Faculty are already strained with fees, bills, stress. No Student or Faculty memember who commutes here regularly should be paying hefty prices for a parking pass. They are already burdened enough.

## Who Should Apply?

You may qualify if you are:

- A UKY student who owns a vehicle
- A faculty or staff member who drives to campus
- A commuter student
- A resident student with a parking permit
- Someone who cannot reasonably use alternative transportation

---

## What do I get if I quallify?

If you are selected in this program, benefits could include:

- Partial or full parking permit assistance
- Long-term parking cost reduction
- Renewals based on continued need

 *This program is currently a class-based pilot initiative and does not guarantee direct financial aid at this time.*

## Why This Matters

At UKY, students and employees who drive daily carry the same financial burden as those who rarely use their permits. We want to present an ICT based solution that can improve fairness in the lives of those who are apart of the university.

*This initiative is presented for academic and proposal purposes as part of a University of Kentucky ICT course.*
