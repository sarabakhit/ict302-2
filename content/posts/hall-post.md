title = 'The Growing Parking Problem at UK'
+++
---

The Campus population at our university continues to rise, with nearly 39,000 students and faculty contributing to a more crowded environment. This increase reflects national patterns, as U.S. undergraduate enrollment grew by 3.2% in 2023 (T2 Systems, 2023). With larger class sizes that means more cars are brought by both in-state and out of state students as well as commuting staff. In fact UKY is hiring more proffesors and staff which means more cars coming and the total amount of parking spaces remaining the same. 

In Fact according to the Kentucky Kernal, "This year the University of Kentucky’s Transportation Services oversold commuter parking passes on a 2-1 ratio"

This means that By the Transportation Service is selling twice as many passes as they have for available spots, which means that roughly half of all people who purchase commuter passes will NOT have anywhere to park. 

You don't have to be a Calculus Major to understand that the math isn't mathing and the ones who have to endure the burdens the most...Our fellow students and staff members.

Here are a few underlying issues we have

---
## Issue 1
While we do appreciate that our university is growing significantly. The issue is that this growth places heavy strain on parking infrastructure and the people who rely on those infrastructures. 

Finding a Parking Spot at used to be a minor inconvience. Now it raises your blood preasure. That is not normal. Or at least I hope it's not normal for you.

## Issue 2 

We've also seen that surrounding Lexington neighborhoods are also affected by reduced parking availability. 

However parking is not just an exclusive problem for us at the University of Kentucky. In fact Campuses nationwide are struggling to balance new found growth with the problems it causes for students and staff members alike.

## Issue 3 
Students and staff are now at risk of being late to class/work because of the self created parking issue by the University. Students and staff members who have long commuting times shouldn't have to worry about finding a parking space, or even be worried about being late. 

Nobody should have to be worried about facing punishment because of something outside of their control. UK HR shouldn't be punishing people because they are struggling to find a parking space.

---
## Issue 4 
Campus construction is another ongoing issue that is caused by UKY's parking problem. Because Construction projects and equipment take up more parking spaces which are already on such short notice.

Construction can actually cause traffic to be even more of a burden on your way to campus, and you don't have an idea when or where it will happen. This means you sometimes don't know if your commute is going to be hindered by traffic.

## Issue 5 
The University has opted to put the profits over the people

The only reason to sell twice as many parking passes for every one parking space is to maximize the profits. There are easy and feasible solutions that the University could Implament 

 - Lower the rate of admissions to reduce the "new largest freshman class" records.
   
 - Maybe don't make invest resources into a new A.I. Major if your students and staff are already facing pressing matters.
   
 - Just sell one parking pass for every one parking spot.
   
 - Give Daily Commuters a lower price for a parking pass because they Commute significantly more BUT have to pay the same rate for someone who rarely uses their car.
   
 - Prioritize the students, and wonderful staff that make UKY a great Campus to begin with.
