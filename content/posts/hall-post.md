Campus population at the University of Kentucky continues to rise, with nearly 39,000 students and faculty contributing to a more crowded environment. This increase reflects national patterns, as U.S. undergraduate enrollment grew by 3.2% in 2023 (T2 Systems, 2023). With larger class sizes that means more cars are brought by both in-state and out of state students as well as commuting staff. In fact UKY is hiring more proffesors and staff which means more cars coming and the total amount of parking spaces remaining the same.

## Issue 1
While we do appreciate that our university is growing significantly. The issue is that this growth places heavy strain on parking infrastructure and the people who rely on those infrastructures. 

Finding a Parking Spot at used to be a minor inconvience. NOw it raises your blood preasure. That is not normal. Or at least I hope it's not normal for you

## Issue 2 

We've also seen that Surrounding Lexington neighborhoods are also affected by reduced parking availability. However Parking is not just an exclusive problem for us at the University of Kentucky. In fact Campuses nationwide are struggling to balance  new found growth with the problems it causes for students and staff members alike.
