## University of Kentucky Student Parking Issues

Parking Issues at the University of Kentucky stem from greediness and 
over-consumption of passes. People are charged $500 a year to park a mile away from their classes!

A Major Underlying problem is the lack of connectivity Students have with each other when it comes to parking. 
 - Prior there has been no group or community that students and staff memembers can relay or inform each other about what Space is Full or what traffic is like
 - The only way for students to know if a Lot is Full is to play wack a mole with the parking spots. This takes time and can be infuriariting to find a spot.
 - there is no way to get an update from a group of students about what parking is like in a specific area, it's just guesswork

Another major issue is that a student who commute and travel daily to get to Campus have to pay the same 500$ as a student who rarely uses their vehicle. Shouldn't there be some form of a discounted or lower price for a student who is in a situation where they have to commute daily? 

It's not fair that both of these students have to pay the exact same ammount when one has to commute significantly more
