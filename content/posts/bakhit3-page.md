UK’s unsatisfactory parking situation is caused by the combination of:
- Oversold parking passes
- Increasing commuter populations
- Limited land availability
- Ongoing construction projects

## Rising Campus Population & Vehicle Demand

Campus life at the University of Kentucky continues to expand year after year. Enrollment has climbed steadily, and with nearly 39,000 students and faculty now part of the university community (Blanton, 2024), the campus has become denser than ever. This pattern mirrors a broader national trend. According to T2 Systems (2023), more than two-thirds of U.S. states saw a 3.2 percent increase in undergraduate enrollment in 2023 alone.

Each record-breaking class brings more than just students and new perspectives—it brings cars. The University of Kentucky hosts students from both in-state and out-of-state, many of whom bring personal vehicles. Faculty and staff also contribute heavily to parking demand, as nearly all employees commute to work. Research supports this trend, noting that “the number of private cars owned by them is increasing rapidly,” which directly “leads to a shortage of campus parking capacity” (Abbood et al., 2021).


## Overselling of Parking Passes & Infrastructure Strain

The same growth that fuels academic opportunity also strains campus infrastructure. Parking availability has not kept pace with demand. Students and faculty both experience the strain in different ways—long walks from distant lots, difficulty finding consistent parking near classrooms or workplaces, and in some cases abandoning driving altogether due to frustration. Others even risk tickets and parking violations to make it to class on time.

A Facebook post from the Kentucky Kernel exposed one of the largest contributors to this issue: “This year the University of Kentucky’s Transportation Services oversold commuter parking passes on a 2-1 ratio” (Kentucky Kernel, 2025). By selling twice as many passes as available spaces, roughly half of all commuter pass holders are left without a guaranteed place to park.

## Student & Faculty Impact

The struggle students face is captured by a quote from the Kentucky Kernel (2023):  
“My freshman year I was right on campus and didn’t have to worry about driving and finding a spot to get to classes on time, now I have to plan to leave home far earlier than I thought I would need to just in case I can’t find a spot.”

Students should never be at risk of missing class because of parking issues, especially when parking is controlled and sold by the university. Faculty members face similar struggles. UK Human Resources states that “arrival any time after the beginning of the scheduled workday or shift is considered late or tardy for performance purposes” (UK HR, 2020). This policy means employees who cannot find parking may face penalties for circumstances outside their control.

Research also shows that parking uncertainty “may contribute to stress… safety concerns, out-of-pocket costs, and uncertainty about finding parking” (Schneider & Wiers, 2022).

## Construction & Parking Lot Loss

Campus construction further reduces already limited parking. “The construction of new buildings has temporarily reduced parking availability including the loss of Orange Lot due to construction of a new building for the United States Department of Agriculture, making employees and some professional graduate students park at South Red Lot” (Pierce, 2025). This displacement demonstrates how construction directly worsens parking access.
